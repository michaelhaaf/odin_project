    <p>
This casserole is the perfect winter dinner! It's gone in seconds in my house. Make sure to use whole-milk ricotta and use more red pepper if you like it hotter.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) box jumbo pasta shells</li>
      <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li> 
      <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li> 
      <li>1 pound Italian sausage, hot or sweet</li> 
      <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li> 
      <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li> 
      <li>1 (26 ounce) jar prepared marinara sauce</li> 
      <li>1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves</li> 
      <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li> 
      <li>1 (15 ounce) container whole milk ricotta cheese</li> 
      <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano plus additional for serving</li> 
      <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream 0 teaspoon kosher salt</li> 
      <li>1 ¼ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li> 
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set a rack in the center of the oven, about 10 inches from the heat source.</p></li>

      <li><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost tender, about 7 minutes. Scoop out 1/2 cup cooking water; set aside. Drain pasta in a colander. Return to pot and toss with 1 tablespoon oil.</p></li>

      <li><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sirloin and sausage and cook, undisturbed, until bottom side is lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Stir, and continue to cook, stirring and breaking up meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 4 minutes.</p></li>

      <li><h3>Step 4</h3><p>Reduce heat to medium. Add onion and garlic, and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce, basil, and crushed red pepper. Remove ragu from heat.</p>
</li>

      <li><h3>Step 5</h3><p>Stir together ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, cream, and salt in a bowl.</p>
</li>

      <li><h3>Step 6</h3><p>To assemble, spread about 2 cups of the ragu in the bottom of a 13- x 9-inch baking dish. Spoon 1/2 of the pasta over sauce. Dollop half of the ricotta mixture over pasta, and sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Spoon remaining pasta over mozzarella cheese. Spread remaining ragu over pasta mixture, and dollop with remaining ricotta mixture. Top with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Cover lasagna with a large sheet of aluminum foil that's been lightly sprayed with cooking spray (to prevent the cheese from sticking to it).</p>
</li>

      <li><h3>Step 7</h3><p>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and remove foil. Increase oven temperature to broil with rack about 10 inches from heat source; preheat 5 minutes. Return baking dish to oven. Broil until cheese is browned in spots, 5 to 8 minutes.</p>
</li> 

    </ul>
